# GitHub Pages Configuration Instructions

## ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions Deployment Issues

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use the official GitHub Pages deployment actions instead of the third-party `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` action that was causing permission errors.

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
- **Replaced**: `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` 
- **With**: Official GitHub Actions:
  - `actions/configure-pages@v5`
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` 
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

### 2. Added Environment Configuration:
- Added `environment: github-pages` for proper permission handling
- Added `url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}` for deployment URL

## ⚙️ Required Repository Settings:

**IMPORTANT**: You need to update your GitHub repository settings:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/365Evergreen/learn-with-365
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the changes

## 🚀 How the New Deployment Works:

1. **Push to main** → Triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Build the app** → Creates production build
3. **Upload artifact** → Packages build files
4. **Deploy to Pages** → Official GitHub deployment with proper permissions

## ✅ Benefits of This Fix:

- **No Permission Errors**: Uses built-in GitHub permissions
- **Official Support**: Uses GitHub's recommended deployment method
- **Better Security**: No need for custom tokens or permissions
- **Automatic URL**: Provides deployment URL in workflow output
- **Environment Tracking**: Shows deployments in GitHub's Environments tab

## 🌐 Your Live Site:

Once the workflow completes successfully:
**URL**: https://365evergreen.github.io/learn-with-365

## 🔍 Monitor Deployment:

- Check **Actions** tab for workflow progress
- Check **Environments** tab for deployment history
- Look for green checkmarks indicating successful deployment

The deployment should now work without the "Permission denied" error! 🎉
